# What is Abalone?
The abalone is a type of marine mollusk characterized by its large, ear-shaped shell and a single, spiral-shaped shell. Highly prized for its tender meat, abalone is often considered a delicacy in many cuisines worldwide. Due to overfishing and habitat degradation, abalone populations face significant threats, leading to conservation efforts to protect these valuable marine creatures. Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope. Number of Rings + 1.5 gives the age of abalone in years.

# Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to create an accurate model for predicting the age of abalone by predicting the number of rings.

# Data Description
Sex : M, F, and I (infant)
Length : Longest shell measurement
Diameter : perpendicular to length
Height : with meat in shell
Whole weight : whole abalone
Shucked weight : weight of meat
Viscera weight: gut weight (after bleeding)
Shell weight : after being dried
Rings : +1.5 gives the age in years
